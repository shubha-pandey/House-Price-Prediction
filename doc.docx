PROBLEM

* Given a dataset of house prices with some features like no of bathrooms, no of bedrooms etc.

* The task is to create a model which will predict the price for any new house by looking at its features

* While learning about ML it's best to actually work with real-world data, not just artificial datasets



ANALYSIS

* Requirements ?

* Business Objective & End Goal ?



FINDING THE RIGHT TYPE OF MODEL TO BUILD

* Supervised , Unsupervised, or Reinforcement learning ?  --> Supervised

* Classification Task or Regression Task ?  --> Regression

* Batch Learning or Online Learning Techniques ?  --> Batch



SELECTING A PERFORMANCE MEASURE

* A typical performance measure for regression problems is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

* RMSE is generally the preferred performance measure for regression tasks, so selecting it for this particular problems

* Other performance metrics include Mean Absolute Error, Manhattan Norm, etc but here RMSE is to be used

RMSE(X, h) = sqrt [(Σ(h(x^i) – y^i)²) / m]



CHECK ASSUMPTIONS

* It's very important to check for any assumptions made & correct them before launching the ML system
